    <string name="textView117">Acceptance</string>
    <string name="textView118">By registering for using the Elshare Service or any portion of it you must accept the Terms and Conditions. Registration without explicit acceptance of the Terms and condition is not possible.</string>

    <string name="textView119">Data Protection</string>

Elshare may use non-personal data collected in the provision of the Service in order to (i) improve the Service and its other products and services, and (ii) share statistical information with its support partners.</string>

    <string name="textView121">Prices</string>
    <string name="textView122">Charging host will be prompted to put their access fees/ profit per kwh and verify the base electricity cost estimated by our smart proprietary algorithm. All applicable prices of the charging service are indicated on the Service platform/ app before the start of the booking process. The Prices may be displayed as fees per kWh of energy, fees per time charging of an electric vehicle at the charging host, as well as any other, indicated fees. You acknowledge that the final price of the charging service is strictly dependent on your use, for example on time of charging, kwh value of consumed energy, and is, therefore, may not always accurately provided before the start of the process. The prices are approximate indication of the use by the customer. It remains the Customer’s responsibility to check the applicable prices through the Elshare App or website prior to initiating a booking and charging. The price indicated on the Elshare App and/or website is the final price that the driver has to pay and does not have to pay anything more to the charging host, unless he wishes to pay the host for good charging experience.</string>

    <string name="textView123">Customer’s Obligations</string>
    <string name="textView124">(1) It is your responsibility to ensure that (i) charging begins and is completed correctly; and (ii) the charging station is suitable for the vehicle to be charged. Further, you shall not use charging stations/ host that show an error message or visible defects or damages.\n\n(2) It is your responsibility to ensure that the registered payment card is valid, that it has a sufficient balance and is not blocked. In the event that debiting is not possible, Elshare has the right to seek payment from you by other means, such as by sending a separate invoice for your use of the Service. As it is your responsibility to ensure that your payment information on the Elshare account is up-to-date and valid at the time of attempting to purchase a charging process through the Service, failure to do so can result in Elshare closing your account.\n\n(3) Upon registering you shall provide your email address and a chosen password for logging into your Elshare account. You must take due care to protect your password against misuse by others and promptly notify Elshare about any misuse. You are responsible for keeping the password secure, for not writing the password down so that third parties can understand what it is used for, and for not using the password in any other way that allows others to gain access to the information.\n\n(4) You are responsible for complying with the specific parking and other (if any) restrictions and regulations at the charging host/ station (such as, for example, the written instructions shown at the charging station or the instructions given by the personnel of the charging station/ charging host).</string>
